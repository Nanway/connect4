# connect4_ios
A quick iOS app to play connect 4 and visualise the results of the RL models I build

Built with Cheers and Tensorflow Lite on xCode 11.0. Models were trained in tensorflow and then converted to tensorflow lite to be run on an iPhone.

The models are at the level of a basic beginner. Most of the time they can block connect 4 columns, sometimes they can play rows and sometimes they can play diagonals. It probably needs a lot more training before they get super good. See this repo https://github.com/Nanway/connect4 for training. 

Can play against human, models and completely random player.

Here are some sample videos of the app in action
